## specification

* Displays a frame with numbers, a table with numbers from 1 to 75,  
a button with the word "turn" on it, and a single bingo card.  

* The center frame of the bingo card displays "free",  
and the first row from the left contains numbers 1 to 15,  
the second row contains numbers 16 to 30, the third row contains numbers 31 to 45,  
the fourth row contains numbers 46 to 60, and the fifth row contains numbers 61 to 75,  
randomly generated and displayed. The numbers must not overlap.  

* Click "free" to start the game and you can click the "turn" button.  

* When you press the "turn" button, a number between 1 and 75 is randomly selected.  
Once a number is selected, it will not be selected again.  

* When a number is chosen, the number in the table is marked.  

* When the number on the bingo card matches the chosen number,  
you can click on it and it will be colored. When the numbers match,  
you cannot press "turn" button until you click on it.  

* When a color is painted in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally,  
"BINGO!" and the result screen will be displayed.  

* The number of times you have turned will be displayed on the result screen,  
and if you press the Retry button, you will restart.
(The bingo machine will reset and display the new bingo cards.)
